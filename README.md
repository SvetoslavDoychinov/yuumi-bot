## What is this project?
This is a personal project of mine that is still in developement. It could have undiscovered bugs and I may be adding more features going forward. Currently it contains two bots - DiscoNunu and Yuumi, but it should be easy for people familiar with python to define their own behaviour using the available code. The Yuumi bot should do the following:

Create a lobby -> Select positions -> Search for game -> Accept matches -> Ban Lux -> Pick Yuumi -> Buy items -> Attach to someone(player on f4) -> Upgrade and use abilities and summoner spells. Repeat.

Everyone is free to do with this project as he/she pleases and I take no responsibility for how it is used.

## How to use
1. Launch LoL and log in to your account. The bot handles the game from the Client Home screen onwards.
2. Install the latest version of Python - https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. Clone the repository
4. Navigate to project location on your PC
5. Run ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
6. Run ``py .\main.py``
7. Enjoy
